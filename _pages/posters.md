### Poster presentations

   - A1 size or 8 A4 PPT slides (which together make an A1 poster)
   - Directions: After putting up your poster, you will stand by it and answer questions from attendees for about 30-45 minutes (but you can wander around and view other poster presentations when there are no questions)
   - A4 Slide Structure:
      1. Title (title, authors, affiliation)
      2. Abstract and Keywords
      3. Introduction (background, motivation, problem statement)
      4. Methods (how you did it)
      5. Methods II or Results I
      6. Results (what you found)
      7. Conclusion (summary, limitations, future work)
      8. References

### Oral presentations (less common), usually 10-15 minutes long

   - Same slides as above, but in a different format (e.g., 10-15 PPT slides)
   - Be prepared to answer questions from the audience
   - Don't be afraid to say "I don't know" if you don't know the answer (the whole point is to learn what you don't yet know, so you can continue researching)
