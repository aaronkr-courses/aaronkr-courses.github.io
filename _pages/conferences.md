# Conferences

## How to Get Started

1. **Find a topic** (use the `ChatGPT` script below to help generate ideas):
   - Something you are interested in
   - Something related to your course or major
   - Something you have done in class (project, paper, etc.)
   - Something you want to learn more about
   - Something you want to share with others
2. **Paper writing** (see the PPTs and [Template Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XRI8KHzocVz4gamFO_V0qjqBXhmhyljl?usp=sharing) below):
    - Conference papers are usually 2-3 pages long
    - Journal papers are usually 4-6 pages long
    - Papers typically include:
      1. Abstract
      2. Introduction
      3. Related Work
      4. Methods
      5. Results
      6. Conclusion
      7. References
3. **Presentation** (preparing slides and practicing):
    - **Poster presentations** (most common)
        - A1 size or 8 A4 PPT slides (which together make an A1 poster)
        - Directions: After putting up your poster, you will stand by it and answer questions from attendees for about 30-45 minutes (but you can wander around and view other poster presentations when there are no questions)
        - A4 Slide Structure:
          1. Title (title, authors, affiliation)
          2. Abstract and Keywords
          3. Introduction (background, motivation, problem statement)
          4. Methods (how you did it)
          5. Methods II or Results I
          6. Results (what you found)
          7. Conclusion (summary, limitations, future work)
          8. References
    - **Oral presentations** (less common), usually 10-15 minutes long
        - Same slides as above, but in a different format (e.g., 10-15 PPT slides)
        - Be prepared to answer questions from the audience 
        - Don't be afraid to say "I don't know" if you don't know the answer (the whole point is to learn what you don't yet know, so you can continue researching)

### ChatGPT Scripts to Help Generate Research Topics

**Option 1**

```plaintext
I am a university student looking for research paper topics related to 
[ your major or field of study, e.g., computer science, engineering, psychology, etc.]. 

Please provide me with a list of 10 potential research topics that are relevant, interesting, and feasible for a student to explore. The topics should be specific enough to allow for focused research but broad enough to find sufficient resources. Additionally, please include a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for each topic to help me understand its significance and potential research questions.
```

**Option 2**

```plaintext
I am preparing to write a short research paper (2?3 pages) for a conference in Korea (정보통신공학회). The paper can be about:
    - a conceptual design (idea for a system/app/device),
    - a literature review (summary of 2?5 related papers),
    - a simple program (small experiment with code/tools), or
    - a survey (ask classmates or friends a few questions).
Please help me find a research topic, paper title ideas, and possible directions for my abstract.

Here is some information about me:
    - Courses I have studied: [e.g., Data Structures, Computer Networks, AI basics]
    - Projects or assignments I have done: [e.g., simple Python programs, Arduino project, class presentations]
    - My skills or tools I know: [e.g., Python, C, MATLAB, Excel, Google Forms]
    - Topics I am curious about: [e.g., AI in education, cybersecurity, VR/AR, IoT, healthcare apps]
    - My future goals (optional): [e.g., Master’s in AI, career in cybersecurity, interest in healthcare technology]

Please suggest:
    1. 5?10 possible research topics that fit my background and interests.
    2. Example paper titles I could use.
    3. A few abstract ideas (1?2 sentences each).
    4. Some keywords I can search in Google Scholar to find related papers.
