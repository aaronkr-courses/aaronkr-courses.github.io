## About Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. The more you learn about Arduino, the more you can do with it. For example, you can build robots, art installations, interactive games, do research for <a href="/conferences/">Conferences</a>, build prototypes, make your <a href="/capstone/">Capstone project</a>, and much more.

## Getting Started

Most Arduino kits come with an Arduino UNO board, USB cable, and a variety of sensors and actuators. You can also buy additional components online or at local electronics stores.

### Lessons

We will use as many of the [Education Starter Kit](https://aesk.arduino.cc) lessons as possible during the course. You may need to create a free account to access the lessons.

**[STUDENT LOG BOOK](https://www.datocms-assets.com/42182/1579608838-aeskstudent-logbook.pdf)**

- [Lesson 1: Getting Started with Arduino](https://aesk.arduino.cc/aesk/module/education/lesson/getting-started)
    - Learn how to set up your Arduino board and install the Arduino IDE software.
- [Lesson 3: Traffic Signals](https://aesk.arduino.cc/aesk/module/education/lesson/traffic-signals)
    - Write programs to control the LEDs in the circuit, including a program for a traffic light.
- [Lesson 4: Dimmer Switch](https://aesk.arduino.cc/aesk/module/education/lesson/dimmer-switch)
    - Attach a potentiometer to the breadboard. The side with two pins should go into holes 28e and 30e. The other pin should be in hole 29g. **(Use wires if necessary.)**
    - Build the "Dimmer Switch Circuit" (halfway down the page).
- [Lesson 5: Holiday Lights](https://aesk.arduino.cc/aesk/module/education/lesson/holiday-lights)
    - Design and create your own light-up circuit.
    - Requirements: You must use between **4-8 LEDs** in your circuit (same color or different is optional).
    - Components: _Push-button switch,_ potentiometer, one digital/one analog pin on the Arduino board.
    - Note: Every LED must have a resistor wired with it in series.
    - Code: Use at least ONE variable and ONE conditional (`if`) statement.
