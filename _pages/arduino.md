## About Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. The more you learn about Arduino, the more you can do with it. For example, you can build robots, art installations, interactive games, do research for <a href="/conferences/">Conferences</a>, build prototypes, make your <a href="/capstone/">Capstone project</a>, and much more.

## Getting Started

Most Arduino kits come with an Arduino UNO board, USB cable, and a variety of sensors and actuators. You can also buy additional components online or at local electronics stores.
