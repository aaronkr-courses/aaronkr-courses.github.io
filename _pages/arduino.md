## About Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. The more you learn about Arduino, the more you can do with it. For example, you can build robots, art installations, interactive games, do research for <a href="/conferences/">Conferences</a>, build prototypes, make your <a href="/capstone/">Capstone project</a>, and much more.

## Getting Started

Most Arduino kits come with an Arduino UNO board, USB cable, and a variety of sensors and actuators. You can also buy additional components online or at local electronics stores.

### Lessons

We will use as many of the [Education Starter Kit](https://aesk.arduino.cc) lessons as possible during the course. You may need to create a free account to access the lessons.

- [Lesson 1: Getting Started with Arduino](https://aesk.arduino.cc/aesk/module/education/lesson/getting-started)
    - Learn how to set up your Arduino board and install the Arduino IDE software.
- [Lesson 3: Traffic Signals](https://aesk.arduino.cc/aesk/module/education/lesson/traffic-signals)
    - Write programs to control the LEDs in the circuit, including a program for a traffic light.
