#### Attendance (& Participation) (10%)

We appreciate everyone being actively involved in the class!
Students who will succeed are those who are actively involved:

- **Active participation:** What does "active participation" look like? It means that you are engaged in the class, asking questions, answering questions, and participating in discussions.
- **Disinterest:** Students who are not interested in the class do not study, do not participate, and do not do well on the tests. They will get a low grade.

#### Assignments & Practice Exercises (30%)

There will be various practice exercises we will do together in class. There will also be some homework assignments for you to do on your own at home and submit online. We may also have some in-class quizzes to be submitted online.
These assignments may contain material that has been covered by published papers and webpages.

#### Projects (10%)

There will be (at least) three projects in this class (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). You will be required to submit a URL with your code or results.

#### Tests (50%)

There will be two tests in this class: a midterm and a final. Both tests may include both written and programming questions. The written questions will be similar to the homework questions, and the programming questions will be similar to the programming assignments. Written questions will be closed-book, and programming questions will be open-book (i.e., you can use any resources you want, including the Internet).

- **Midterm:** 20%
- **Final:** 30%

#### Collaboration Policy

**Homework assignments must be done individually:** each student must hand in their own answers.
However, it is acceptable to collaborate when figuring out answers and to help each other solve the problems.
We will be assuming that you will be taking the responsibility to make sure you personally understand the solution arising from such collaboration.
You also must indicate on each homework with whom you have collaborated.

#### Late Policy

You will be allowed **6 total homework late days** without penalty for the entire semester.
You may be late by up to 6 days on any homework assignment.
Once those days are used, you will be penalized according to the following policy:

- Homework is worth full credit at the due time on the due date.
- The allowed late days are counted by day (i.e., each new late day starts at 12:00 am ET).
- Once the allowed late days are exceeded, the penalty is 50% per late day conted by hour (i.e., 2.0833% per hour).
- The homework is worth zero credit 48 hours after exceeding the late day limit.

You must turn in 75% of the practices and assignments, even if for zero credit, in order to pass the course.

#### Regrade Policy

If you feel that we have made a mistake in grading your homework, please submit a regrading request via email and I will consider your request.
Please note that regrading of a homework may cause your grade to go either up or down.
