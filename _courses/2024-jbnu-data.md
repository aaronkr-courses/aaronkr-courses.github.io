## Overview 개요

<strong>Data Structures the Fun Way</strong> <a href="https://nostarch.com/data-structures-fun-way">No Starch Link</a>

This accessible and entertaining book provides an in-depth introduction to computational thinking through the lens of data structures — a critical component in any programming endeavor. Through diagrams, pseudocode, and humorous analogies, you’ll learn how the structure of data drives algorithmic operations, gaining insight into not just how to build data structures, but precisely how and when to use them.

This book will give you a strong background in implementing and working with more than 15 key data structures, from stacks, queues, and caches to bloom filters, skip lists, and graphs. Master linked lists by standing in line at a cafe, hash tables by cataloging the history of the summer Olympics, and Quadtrees by neatly organizing your kitchen cabinets. Along with basic computer science concepts like recursion and iteration, you’ll learn:

* The complexity and power of pointers
* The branching logic of tree-based data structures
* How different data structures insert and delete data in memory
* Why mathematical mappings and randomization are useful
* How to make tradeoffs between speed, flexibility, and memory usage

_Data Structures the Fun Way_ shows how to efficiently apply these ideas to real-world problems—a surprising number of which focus on procuring a decent cup of coffee. At any level, fully understanding data structures will teach you core skills that apply across multiple programming languages, taking your career to the next level.
