## Overview 개요

<strong>ISE Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, 7th Edition</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ISE-Fundamentals-of-Electric-Circuits/dp/1260570797">Amazon</a>

Fundamentals of Electric Circuits continues in the spirit of its successful previous editions, with the objective of presenting circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other, more traditional texts. A balance of theory, worked & extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 580 new or changed homework problems complete this edition.

Robust media offerings renders this text to be the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis. The seventh edition retains the "Design a Problem" feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question, as well as the solution. There are over 100 "Design a Problem" exercises integrated into problem sets in the book.

McGraw-Hill''s Connect, is also available with Fundamentals of Electric Circuits. Connect provides an ebook experience for students and enables professors to assign and assess reading, homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student''s work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers an may also have a "multi-step solution" which helps move the students'' learning along if they experience difficulty.

<strong>Exploring Arduino: Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry, 2nd Edition</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Arduino-Techniques-Engineering-Wizardry/dp/1119405378">Amazon</a>

Exploring Arduino makes electrical engineering and embedded software accessible. Learn step by step everything you need to know about electrical engineering, programming, and human-computer interaction through a series of increasingly complex projects. Arduino guru Jeremy Blum walks you through each build, providing code snippets and schematics that will remain useful for future projects. Projects are accompanied by downloadable source code, tips and tricks, and video tutorials to help you master Arduino. You'll gain the skills you need to develop your own microcontroller projects!

Whether you're a first-timer just starting out in electronics, or a pro looking to mock-up more complex builds, Arduino is a fantastic tool for building a variety of devices. This book offers a comprehensive tour of the hardware itself, plus in-depth introduction to the various peripherals, tools, and techniques used to turn your little Arduino device into something useful, artistic, and educational. Exploring Arduino is your roadmap to adventure―start your journey today!
