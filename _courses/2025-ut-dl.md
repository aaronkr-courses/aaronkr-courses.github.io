## Overview 개요

<img style="float: left; width: 150px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="/assets/img/books/electric-circuits.jpg" />

<strong>ISE Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, 7th Edition</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ISE-Fundamentals-of-Electric-Circuits/dp/1260570797">Amazon</a>

Fundamentals of Electric Circuits continues in the spirit of its successful previous editions, with the objective of presenting circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other, more traditional texts. A balance of theory, worked & extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 580 new or changed homework problems complete this edition.

Robust media offerings renders this text to be the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis. The seventh edition retains the "Design a Problem" feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question, as well as the solution. There are over 100 "Design a Problem" exercises integrated into problem sets in the book.

McGraw-Hill''s Connect, is also available with Fundamentals of Electric Circuits. Connect provides an ebook experience for students and enables professors to assign and assess reading, homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student''s work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers an may also have a "multi-step solution" which helps move the students'' learning along if they experience difficulty.
