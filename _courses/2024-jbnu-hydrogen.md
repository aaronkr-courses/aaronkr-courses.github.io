## Overview 개요

<strong>Hydrogen and Fuel Cells</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780081007082/hydrogen-and-fuel-cells">Science Direct Link</a>

In a multidisciplinary field such as energy, _Hydrogen and Fuel Cells_ stands out by covering the entire width of hydrogen production and usage technologies, giving detailed descriptions of not just one but the range of very different fuel cells that have been developed or are under development.

In one volume, respected experts Bent Sorensen and Giuseppe Spazzafumo provide all the basic scientific theory underlying hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, but at the same time present applications and sustainable integration into society in a way accessible to a broad range of people working in this field, whether in technical, economic or management roles. The third edition reflects both recently emerged technologies and the market penetration of the most promising technologies, and it gives an appraisal of how far fuel cell technology may go in the future, considering current challenges and economic trends.

This new edition has updated and expanded content on hydrogen storage and transmission, molten carbonate fuel cells, PEM fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, biofuel cells, including microbial fuel cells, applications in transportation and power plants, future scenarios and life-cycle assessment. It is ideal for researchers and professionals in the field of energy, and renewable energy in particular, both in academia and industry. It is also useful to lecturers and graduate students in engineering, physics, and environmental sciences, as well as professionals involved in energy or environmental regulation and policy.

**Key Features**

* Gain thorough understanding of the science and applications of hydrogen and a range of different fuel cells, including economic and social aspects of the field
* Updated sections include hydrogen storage and transportation, biofuel cells, PEM and solid oxide fuel cells, applications in transportation and large scale power generation, and life-cycle assessment

## Logistics 수업운영

### Course Information / 과정정보

This course focuses on the latest Hydrogen Fuel Cell technologies and their applications. The course will cover the basic principles of hydrogen production, storage, and fuel cell operation. The course will also cover the latest research and development in the field of hydrogen fuel cells.

We will use a combination of lectures and videos to cover the material. The course will be graded based on attendance, participation, tests, and a final project.

### Policies 규정

#### Grading 평가방법

The class requirements include attendance, participation, a team research paper and presentation, and 2 tests.
The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Attendance (& Participation)
- Research Paper & Presentation
- Midterm Test
- Final Test

---

#### Attendance (& Participation)

I appreciate everyone being actively involved in the class!
Students who will succeed are those who are actively involved:

- **Active participation:** What does "active participation" look like? It means that you are engaged in the class, asking questions, answering questions, and participating in discussions.
- **Disinterest:** Students who are not interested in the class do not study, do not participate, and do not do well on the tests. They will get a low grade.

#### Research Project & Presentation

There will be a final (team) research project and presentation. various practice exercises we will do together in class. There will also be some homework assignments for you to do on your own at home and submit online. We may also have some in-class quizzes to be submitted online.
These assignments may contain material that has been covered by published papers and webpages.

There will be (at least) three projects in this class (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). You will be required to submit a URL with your code or results.

#### Tests

There will be two tests in this class: a midterm and a final. Both tests may include both written and programming questions. The written questions will be similar to the homework questions, and the programming questions will be similar to the programming assignments. Written questions will be closed-book, and programming questions will be open-book (i.e., you can use any resources you want, including the Internet).

- **Midterm:** 20%
- **Final:** 30%

#### Collaboration Policy

**Homework assignments must be done individually:** each student must hand in their own answers.
However, it is acceptable to collaborate when figuring out answers and to help each other solve the problems.
We will be assuming that you will be taking the responsibility to make sure you personally understand the solution arising from such collaboration.
You also must indicate on each homework with whom you have collaborated.

#### Late Policy

You will be allowed **6 total homework late days** without penalty for the entire semester.
You may be late by up to 6 days on any homework assignment.
Once those days are used, you will be penalized according to the following policy:

- Homework is worth full credit at the due time on the due date.
- The allowed late days are counted by day (i.e., each new late day starts at 12:00 am ET).
- Once the allowed late days are exceeded, the penalty is 50% per late day conted by hour (i.e., 2.0833% per hour).
- The homework is worth zero credit 48 hours after exceeding the late day limit.

You must turn in 75% of the practices and assignments, even if for zero credit, in order to pass the course.

#### Regrade Policy

If you feel that we have made a mistake in grading your homework, please submit a regrading request via email and I will consider your request.
Please note that regrading of a homework may cause your grade to go either up or down.
