## Overview 개요

<img style="float: left; width: 150px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="/assets/img/books/semiconductor-devices.jpg" />

<strong>Semiconductor Devices: Theory and Application</strong> <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/semiconductor-devices-theory-and-application">Open Textbook Library</a>

This book discusses the features and applications of the fundamental semiconductor devices such as diodes, bipolar junction transistors, junction field effect transistors, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors, and insulated gate bipolar transistors. These are the basic devices that are used in industry and they should be covered in an introductory semiconductor or electronic course.

**What You'll Learn:**

- Semiconductor Fundamentals
- PN Junctions and Diodes
- Diode Applications
- Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)
- BJT Biasing
- Amplifier Concepts
- BJT Small Signal Amplifiers
- BJT Class A, B Power Amplifiers
- Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFETs)
- JFET Small Signal Amplifiers
- Metal Oxide Semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs)
- MOSFET Small Signal Amplifiers
- Class D Power Amplifiers
- Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)
